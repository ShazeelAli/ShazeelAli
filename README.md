* WebRTC/WebSockets

**Highlights**

Fighting game using a Websocket Relay for WebRTC tunneling.

Synchornization using UDP packet transfer and reconciliation

Server used was set ups using NodeJS

Finally settled on Brokered Peer to peer as it was the simplest to setup and taught me about firewalls, port forwarding and routing

#### JavaFX Theft Mystery
**Technologies Used :**
* C
* Collabrotive Git

**Highlights**

Used Object Oriented Programming to create multiple distinct scenes with characters powered by ChatGPT API.

**Technologies Used :**
* Matlab

**Highlights**

Image fingerprinting using an algorithm to transform a 2d array into a 1 dimensional bit array. This bit array is then used to compare to other images bit arrays to compare similarity.
